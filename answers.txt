Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Github is a Distributed VCS (Version Control System) that allows for
both collaborative work on a project and cloud storage of projects. Not only 
does it make it easy to share source code with others, but it also tracks all 
history, commits, and updates. This is helpful when working on projects with 
both multiple individuals, or just yourself, because you can track where and 
when something goes wrong, and still have access to prior code reverse it. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data Science can be applied to almost any field involving the
processing for data. For example, I completed an AI/Machine Learning 
internship at the FDA, where we used data science methodologies, such as 
block design, simulation based data collection, alongside pandas and 
matplotlib, to conduct research on inner cranial brain hemorrhages in children.
This was a biomedical application, but there are plenty of retail or corporate 
applications of data science as well!
