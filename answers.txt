Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Github is a Distributed VCS (Version Control System) that allows for
both collaborative work on a project and cloud storage of projects. Not only 
does it make it easy to share source code with others, but it also tracks all 
history, commits, and updates. This is helpful when working on projects with 
both multiple individuals, or just yourself, because you can track where and 
when something goes wrong, and still have access to prior code reverse it.
