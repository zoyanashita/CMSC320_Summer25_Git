Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data Science can be applied to almost any field involving the
processing for data. For example, I completed an AI/Machine Learning 
internship at the FDA, where we used data science methodologies, such as 
block design, simulation based data collection, alongside pandas and 
matplotlib, to conduct research on intercranial brain hemmorahges in children.
This was a biomedical application, but there are plenty of retail or corporate 
applications of data science as well!
